# Deployment Best Practices

## Overview
Deita deployments prioritize reproducibility, security, and operational simplicity. The following practices ensure reliable releases and maintainable infrastructure.

## Containerization
- **Docker multi-stage builds** for small, secure images
- **.dockerignore** to exclude unnecessary files
- **Non-root user** in containers for security
- **Environment variables** for configuration
- **Healthcheck** instructions in Dockerfiles

## Orchestration
- **Docker Compose** for local and production deployments
- **Service separation**: backend, frontend, database, object storage
- **Resource limits** for CPU/memory in Compose files
- **Named volumes** for persistent data

## CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions** for automated build, test, and deploy
- **Build/test on every PR and push to main**
- **Tagging and versioning** for releases
- **Rollback capability** via previous image tags

## Secrets & Configuration
- **Docker secrets** for sensitive data in production
- **Environment parity**: staging matches production
- **No secrets in code or repo**

## Monitoring & Logging
- **Centralized logging** (stdout/stderr)
- **Posthog** for analytics and anomaly detection
- **Alerting for failed deploys or resource exhaustion**

## Security
- **TLS/HTTPS** for all external endpoints
- **Regular image scanning** for vulnerabilities (Trivy, Hadolint)
- **Minimal base images** (e.g., python:3.11-slim)

## Backup & Recovery
- **Automated backups** for PostgreSQL and object storage
- **Disaster recovery plan** for data loss scenarios

## Extensibility
- Ready for migration to Kubernetes or cloud-native stack as user base grows
