# Development Best Practices

## Overview
Deita's development process emphasizes code quality, maintainability, security, and rapid iteration. The following practices are recommended for all contributors.

## Coding Standards
- **Python:** PEP8, Black, isort, Flake8 for linting/formatting
- **TypeScript/React:** ESLint, Prettier, strict typing
- **Consistent naming conventions** for files, variables, and functions
- **Modular code structure** (FastAPI routers, React components)
- **Avoid premature optimization**; focus on clarity and correctness first

## Testing
- **Unit tests:** Pytest (backend), Jest/React Testing Library (frontend)
- **Integration tests:** Pytest, Playwright (E2E)
- **Test coverage:** Aim for >80% on critical modules
- **Automated CI:** All tests run on GitHub Actions before merge

## Documentation
- **Inline docstrings** for Python functions/classes
- **JSDoc comments** for TypeScript
- **Markdown docs** for architecture, API, onboarding
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** for backend API

## Security & Privacy
- **No secrets in code or repo**; use env vars and Docker secrets
- **Input validation** on all endpoints
- **Regular dependency updates** and vulnerability scanning

## Collaboration
- **Pull request reviews** required for all merges
- **Descriptive commit messages** and PR titles
- **Issue tracking** for bugs, features, and technical debt
- **Respect code ownership and boundaries**

## DevOps
- **Docker for all environments** (dev, test, prod)
- **Environment parity**: local matches production as closely as possible
- **Automated deployments** via GitHub Actions
- **Rollback strategy** for failed deploys

## Extensibility
- Design for future features: microservices, external integrations, advanced AI
