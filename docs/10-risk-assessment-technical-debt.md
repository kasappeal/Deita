# Risk Assessment & Technical Debt Considerations

## Overview
Proactive risk management and technical debt tracking are essential for Deita's long-term success. This document identifies key risks, their impact, and mitigation strategies, as well as technical debt management practices.

## Key Risks & Mitigations

### 1. Data Privacy & Compliance
- **Risk:** GDPR/SOC2 violations due to improper data handling or retention
- **Mitigation:** Automated deletion, encryption, regular audits, user consent flows

### 2. AI Model Accuracy
- **Risk:** Inaccurate SQL generation or explanations may mislead users
- **Mitigation:** Continuous model evaluation, user feedback, fallback to manual SQL

### 3. File Upload & Processing
- **Risk:** Malformed or very large files causing backend failures
- **Mitigation:** Strict validation, file size limits, background processing, error feedback

### 4. Abuse of Public Workspaces
- **Risk:** Spam, inappropriate content, or resource exhaustion
- **Mitigation:** Rate limiting, abuse detection, workspace inactivity deletion

### 5. Scalability Bottlenecks
- **Risk:** Resource exhaustion with increased user load
- **Mitigation:** Container scaling, async processing, monitoring, clear upgrade path

### 6. Dependency Vulnerabilities
- **Risk:** Security issues in third-party libraries
- **Mitigation:** Regular dependency scanning, automated updates, security reviews

### 7. Data Loss
- **Risk:** Accidental deletion or corruption of user data
- **Mitigation:** Automated backups, disaster recovery plan, user confirmation for destructive actions

## Technical Debt Management
- **Issue Tracking:** All known debt tracked in GitHub Issues
- **Documentation:** Debt items documented with impact and remediation plan
- **Review Cadence:** Regular review of debt backlog and prioritization
- **Remediation:** Address debt in each sprint; avoid accumulating high-impact debt
- **Communication:** Debt status visible to all contributors

## Example Technical Debt Items
- Monolithic backend (may need refactoring for scale)
- Minimal frontend state management (may need Redux or similar)
- Basic AI model (may need retraining or replacement)
- Limited test coverage on non-critical paths

## Extensibility
- Ready for future risk management: audit logs, advanced monitoring, external compliance tools
